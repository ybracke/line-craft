# `line-craft`

A simple toolkit for creating modified versions of text-based files. Changes are applied line-wise. Specifically, the software provides functionality to:  
(1) Write a version of the file where certain modifications have been applied to each line.  
(2) Write a version of the file where only lines that fulfil some condition are retained.  
(3) Write a version of the file where only a random subset of lines is retained (sampled).
